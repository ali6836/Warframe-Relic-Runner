# Warframe-Relic-Runner
A program that I wrote a few years ago that works out which relics to purchase on the market to make a profit by running them. Recently I saw that algorithmic trading is a thing on WF now, so I thought I might as well publicise this. It's written in pretty scrappy Python, but what can you expect from a bored 16 year old wanting to make a quick profit in Warframe.

# THIS PROGRAM IS SUPER SLOW TO RUN DUE TO WARFRAME MARKET API USAGE.
